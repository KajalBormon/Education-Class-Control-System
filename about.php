    Our class management system is a web-based application designed to help educators to manage their classrooms more effectively. It is a software tool that can be used to automate administrative tasks, online assignment submission, provides real-time access to information about student performance and progress. The purpose of our system is to make it easier for teachers to manage their classes, save time, and create a more effective learning environment for students. On the other hand, students can check their own attendance records, access resources shared by their teachers and submit assignments there so that the respective course teacher can get that directly. It can help teachers organize and track attendance as well as provide a central location for important class resources, such as syllabus, reading materials and assignments.
